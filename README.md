# Personalized Cancer Diagnosis

## Description

A lot has been said during the past several years about how precision medicine and more concretely. How genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated. 
Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). As not all mutations lead to cancer.
Due to a mutation in a gene, there is some genetic variation developed in a gene. But the question comes, from which particular mutation this genetic variation happened in a gene. Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually which is a very time-consuming task. Based on a gene and a variation in it, a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence form text-based clinical literature.

## Business Problem

### The workflow is as follows:

1. A molecular pathologist selects a list of genetic variations of interest that want to analyze.

2. The molecular pathologist searches for evidence in the medical literature that somehow are relevant to the genetic variations of interest.

3.Finally, this molecular pathologist spends a huge amount of time analyzing the evidence related to each of the variations to classify them into any one of the 9 different classes. Our goal here is to replace step 3 by a machine learning model. The molecular pathologist will still have to decide which variations are of interest, and also collect the relevant evidence for them. But the last step, which is also the most time consuming, will be fully automated by a machine learning model.
